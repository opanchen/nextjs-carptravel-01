A simplified landing page of a Ukrainian travel company that shows the user information about the company, a basic set of services, and also provides an opportunity to send an application and join the team.

## Creating

The project was built using **`npx create-next-app@latest`**, which set up initial project structure automatically including **TS**, **ESLint**, **Tailwind CSS**, App Router, 'src/' directory and import alias (@/\*) as well. To get acquainted and configure additional features refer to [documentation](https://nextjs.org/).

It has responsive (till screen width 480px) and adaptive (more than 480px) design. General styles were created using **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**. Some specific elements (such as pseudo-elements or background images) were styled with **CSS**.

Image sliders for sections "Services" and "Gallery" were implemented using **[Swiper](https://swiperjs.com)**.

Forms were created and validated using **[React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)** combining with **[react-input-mask](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-input-mask-3.0/v/3.0.0)** package.
